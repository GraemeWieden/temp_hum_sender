Temperature and humidity sensor and sender project
==================================================

This Arduino project illustrates how to use an inexpensive DHT series temperature and humidity sensor and a 433 MHz ASK RF transmitter module with an Arduino to emulate the standard Ninja Blocks wireless temperature/humidity sensor.

The following two Arduino libraries are required and must be available in the Arduino sketchbook `libraries` directory.
- DHT from https://github.com/markruys/arduino-DHT
- WT450Sender from https://github.com/GraemeWieden/WT450Sender

For full step-by-step instructions on how to put together the hardware and software, take a look at this project's wiki here:
